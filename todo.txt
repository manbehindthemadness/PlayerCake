Phase_1:

    Establish a connection and data exchange between Director and Stage.

    Establish connection drop and reconnection recovery.

    Create initial script render capability within Writer.

    Implement script delivery to Director and deployment to stage.

    Implement basic script reading cabilities for Stage.


General_notes:

    We are going to need to decide if calibrations are handled on the Stage or if they are moved upstream to Writed through the Director.
        I think we will keep positional trims in Writer and transient (pressure and such) on the Stage...

    The first chore involving Audience is going to need to be some sort of QR code onboarding process.
