Software:
Phase_1:
    Goal: Create basic software functionality and confirm the rendering technique will accommodate the processing hardware available.
    Establish a connection and data exchange between Director and Stage. - In progress
        Connections should discover the tcp address of the target member using UDP broadcast. - Complete
        Each application should be able to accept and initiate connections. - In progress
        Connections should be secured using key pairs and member identification UUIDs. - In progress
        Data transfer should have disconnect and resume tolerance in the event of poor connections. - Pending
        Create Heckle functionality allowing for direct command interrupts to members for troubleshooting. - Pending

    Create initial script render capability within Writer. - Pending
        Script should calculate all required kinematics for basic operations.
        Script should calculate known trim offsets for a configurable number of Actors.
        Script needs to have configurable resolution.
        Script should output to matplotlib for trajectory analysis.
        Script must be modular and allow for a flexible number of actors with unique configurations.

    Implement script delivery to Director and deployment to stage. - Pending
        Director must be able to notify Stage when updated Script files are available.
        Stage must be able to ask Director if new Script files are available.
        Stage must be able to determine the time and method of Script updates.
        Stage must be able to perform init and power on self tests to verify Script files usability.

    Implement basic script reading abilities for Stage. - Pending
        Stage must perform a series of performance tests to determine processing delays and identify throughput bottlenecks.
        Stage must be able to layer Script actions using priority, offset, reversal, rate, and interrupt.
        Stage must be able to factor Improvisor data to determine Cue faults to prevent physical damage to the platform.
            Irrecoverable positions.
            Power off conditions.
            Tolerance of the Actors.
            Lay down and die when damage or malfunction is detected.
Phase_2:
    Goal: Phase 2 goals will be specified once we have confirmed that phase 1 design is viable.


General_notes:

    We are going to need to decide if calibrations are handled on the Stage or if they are moved upstream to Writer through the Director.
        I think we will keep positional trims in Writer and transient (pressure and such) on the Stage...

    The first chore involving Audience is going to need to be some sort of QR code onboarding process.
